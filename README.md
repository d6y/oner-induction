# A 1R implementation in Rust

Re-implementing the 1R algorithm described in [Holte (1993)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1022631118932).

1R learns a rule (`IF...THEN...ELSE`) based on one attribute (feature) of the database. This gives a baseline performance for comparing with other algorithms.
